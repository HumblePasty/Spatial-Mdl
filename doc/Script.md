We’re map mad scientists.

Now let’s talk about light pollution, so this is a photo I took about a year ago in Kunming, Yunnan, China. It was supposed to be a picture of the stars. It looks different with naked eye

To provide more general knowledge on the topic that we are talking about, the official unit of measure for brightness of a celestial body is the magnitude. 

It has a range from negative twenty seven to positive 30. Basically the smaller the value is, the brighter the object it is. Sun and moon.

Based on that, naked eye limiting magnitude means the magnitude of the faintest star you can observe with your naked eye in the night sky. Given that human can only +6 or above objects, we would say the you have a clear night sky if it has a limiting magnitude of, for example, 4 or below.

Sky brightness can be measured quantitatively by equipment through Magnitude per square arcsecond. Typically in the night, this measurement will range between 16 and 22. (which we also used as a filter) There is a complex function that maps each measured result to the more interpretable limiting magnitude. Let’s not bother with the detail of it. But I think it is worth mentioning that this function is bijective.

The data source that inspired this report is from the Globe Night Project. It combines self-reported data and data from the official measuring matrix at over 2000 locations and among that, over 800 are located within continental US. This is the map of all the locations
